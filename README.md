# The Odin Project Web Development 101
## Project: Etch A Sketch

This project was intended to put into practice what I have been learning about DOM manipulation in JavaScript. Although simple, it also allowed me to explore more CSS, CSS Grid, and Flex Box. 

The styling is very simplistic, but I intentionally designed it after the original retro Etch A Sketch. See the photo in the images folder for reference.
